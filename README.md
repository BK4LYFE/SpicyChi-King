# SpicyChi-King

A group repository dedicated to learning about and contributing to open source projects (but also Ryan's favorite BK meal).

Current focus: Study the project "OpenMRS" and make a code contribution to demonstrate knowledge and experience gained while working on the project.

This software project is based on the GNU General Public License. This lets people do anything they want with our project. We can't make it closed source.
